* Shouldn't we store the config at a path like this: https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/advanced-configuration#examples (while leveraging the .codeclimate.yml file)
* Wrap all configs with "codeClimate" so that it is possible to store the configs in package.json
* Take note at the linting changes
* Remove unnecessary files - if files might be used later on store them in `local/deprecated` with the same folder structure
* Take note at the container-structure-test changes
